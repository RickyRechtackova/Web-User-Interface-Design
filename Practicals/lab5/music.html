                <div class="text">Feelin' Groovy is a great example of a song that sums up big chunks of the hippie movement. The point of it is that life moves quickly, so it's important to take things slow and be present. Take time to appreciate the world around you and be thankful for it instead of always rushing and stressing over everything. It advocates that you can find more happiness this way.</div>

                    </video></div>
                <div class="text">There have been plenty of people who've tried to vilify or weaken the position of the hippie movement throughout history, with “hippie” even being used in a derogatory way. But the movement was able to achieve social changes, in part at least, because it took the leap and called for them. Imagine asks us to take a moment and imagine what the world could look like if we did change, what we could be if we weren't fighting or greedy or pitted against each other. It's one of the most enduring, important, and popular hippie songs ever composed.</div>

                    </video></div>
                <div class="text">One of the major parts of the hippie movement was dreaming of a better future or at least being in a better place. California Dreamin' hits that nail on the head by metaphorically seeking to be in a better place which in actuality is a commentary on finding a new moral and cultural standard.</div>

                    </video></div>
                <div class="text">This song by Bob Dylan has been covered by numerous other artists thanks to its poetic questioning of social issues and the fact that it points out that solutions are out there, but nobody is trying to find them. The answer proposed in the song is that the answer is just “blowin' in the wind,” but it remains fairly ambiguous.</div>

                    </video></div>
                <div class="text">In Heart of Gold, Neil Young describes the search for kindness in a world that seems very cold and cruel. It discusses the true hope of finding genuinely nice people, but there hasn't been much success. The song works well as a hippie song that helped bind together people who had similar ideas about sharing, kindness, and community.</div>
