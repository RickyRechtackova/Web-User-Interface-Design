My website is focused on the hippie movement and its mainly an informational site. Its focus audience is anyone that wants to know more about the movement.
Right now it only contains a lorem ipsum text and an image found on google images, but i plan on expanding it with actual text.

I have added a proper text on the homepage, this text is copied from the wikipedia article about the hippie movement. I have also started working on the Photo archive page of my website. Initially i tried spacing the images out with just margin and padding but later decided to use a table instead. I see that this method is not perfect for this as it is not responsive and I will try to fix it in the future.
